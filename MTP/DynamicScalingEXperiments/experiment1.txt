Latency measurement through RAN log.
Rx-throughput from DNN
Core startup times from UPF.
Initial SEtup:
Increase the number of cores slowly from 1 to 4.
Initial Delay on  every core: 150 us
Step change: 30 us
Final Delay : 0us
Interval of switch : 10 seconds.
For first 60 seconds, only 1 core will run. Next 60 second 2 cores, next 60 seconds 3 cores and so on.
Why such a slow increase? To increase the inter core launching time.
